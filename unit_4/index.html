		<p>I am, at heart, a documentarian and sentimentalist. Our experiences and relationships make us who we are. Everyone has a story. It would be an honor to capture yours in an honest and unique way. My shooting style is mostly unobtrusive and relaxed, with an eye towards unscripted moments and unique details.</p>
